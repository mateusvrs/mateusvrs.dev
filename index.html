            I'm an evolving Software Engineer being graduate at <a href="https://www.ufmg.br/">UnB (University of
                Brasilia)</a> and interested in Competitive Programming, Web Development and Big Data. Therefore, I am
            willing to face challenges to improve my hard and soft skills.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I've always been passionate about math challenges, and when I started learning to program at the end
                of 2018, it was no different, and soon in 2020, I loved the competitive programming area üíª. Since then,
                I have become an enthusiast of algorithms and data structures, and now I am preparing to the <a
                    href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC</a>. Also, despite having started with IOT and robotics, in 2021, I
                was introduced to the web development area. From that, I started studying to be a full-stack web
                developer by learning about design patterns, big data, and other internet/web concepts ‚öôÔ∏è. Therefore, it
                can be said that I am a big lover of data manipulation, algorithm analysis, and implementation of
                efficient code.</p>
